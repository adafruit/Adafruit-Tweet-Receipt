REQUIRES ARDUINO IDE 1.0 OR LATER -- Back-porting is not likely to
occur, as the code is deeply dependent on the Stream class, etc.

Also requires Adafruit Thermal Printer Library:
http://github.com/adafruit/Thermal-Printer-Library

Required hardware includes an Ethernet-connected Arduino board such
as the Arduino Ethernet or other Arduino-compatible board with an
Arduino Ethernet Shield, plus an Adafruit Mini Thermal Receipt printer
and all related power supplies and cabling.
